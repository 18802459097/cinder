fixes:
  - Fixed concurrency issue in K2 iSCSI and FC Cinder drivers
    due to possible race conditions between attach and detach
    volumes and due to limitation from Kaminario K2 iSCSI and
    FC arrays on concurrent operations.
    To overcome array limitation, use locks and retry mechanism
    on each K2 requests. To overcome race conditions, use locks
    on initialize_connection and terminate_connection.
