upgrade:
  - To get rid of long running DB data migrations that must be run offline,
    Cinder will now be able to execute them online, on a live cloud. Before
    upgrading from Newton to Ocata operator needs to perform all the Newton
    data migrations. To achieve that he needs to perform `cinder-manage db
    online-data-migrations` until there are no records to be updated. To limit
    DB performance impact migrations can be performed in chunks limited by
    `--max_number` option. If your intent is to upgrade Cinder in a non-live
    manner, you can use `--ignore-state` option safely. Please note that
    finishing all the Newton data migrations will be enforced by the first
    schema migration in Ocata, so you won't be able to upgrade to Ocata without
    that.
